- Mercenaries: Some things are clarified in this document, like their role(s) and usefulness and differences and similarities with citizen-soldiers

=================================================

BATTALIONS IN FORMATION
- Number of formation buttons are reduced
- Formations give bonuses and penalties
- Can be altered with a small numnber of Formation Modifiers
- Most civs will only have 3 Formations for their Battalions and then 3 Modifiers

=================================================

Break/Form
- This button (Hotkey: Spacebar?) is a toggle that breaks and forms units into Battalions. They will automatically form into a Battle Line formation for Infantry and Ranged Cavalry, or Wedge formation for Melee Cavalry. Once formed, they gain their bonuses and penalties and can be selected and commanded as one entity. A flag carrier or standard bearer actor appears to show that these soldiers are now grouped into formation as a "Battalion"

=============================

MIXED GROUPS OF FORMATIONS OR BATTALIONS

When a mixed group of units is formed together, units will form into battalions with other units of like-type: melee infantry in the middle, cavalry on the flanks, and ranged units in the rear.

=================================================

CITIZEN-SOLDIER RANKS/PROMOTIONS
- Each new rank improves all stats by about +10% or 1.1x
- Each new rank decreases economic usefulness by about -25%.

=================================================

CHAMPIONS
- Most stats +50% or 1.5x over their Citizen-Soldier counterparts of Basic Rank
- No economic abilities, though may have various kinds of inspiration auras affecting their citizen counterparts or other units
- Some Champions may have training limits, due to their elite status
- Champions are trained in Battalions/Formations by default (because they don't need to be broken up for fine-tuned economic tasks), except for the Persian Immortals who are trained extremely rapidly individually.

=================================================

PERSIAN IMMORTALS AND SATRAPY TRIBUTE
- The Persian Palace ("Apadana") has a toggle that switches between Satrapy Tribute (a trickle of free resources) or a constant stream of free Immortals Champion Infantrymen ("Anusiya") up to 50 alive at one time (the stream shuts off once the number of live Immortals hits 50, then resumes once 1 or more Immortals die). Immortals are not trained directly, only acquired in this way. The speed of both the Tribute trickle and Immortals trickle can be upgraded at the "Apadana" Palace.

=================================================

HEROES
- Health roughly +400% or 5x over their Citizen-Soldier counterparts of Basic Rank
- Other stats roughly +200% or 3x over their Citizen-Soldier counterparts of Basic Rank
- When placed in a formation, they are protected from focus fire (the whole formation is targeted, not specific units within it)

=================================================

MERCENARIES
- Types available to players based on map biome and player's civilization
- Trained at Mercenary Camps dotted around the map, the number of camps determined by the number of players: 1 merc camp for 2 players, 2 merc camps for 3-4 players, 3 merc camps for 5-6 players
- Cost no population, but can only be trained in limited numbers or are otherwise limited in some way; this is normally the only way a player can train more units above the population cap
- Metal is almost always one of their costs, usually replacing the Food cost
- They do not perform economic tasks, but they can build structures
- They do not contribute to gaining Loot, as they "keep booty for themselves"
- The rest of their stats are comparable to their citizen-soldier counterparts at the Elite rank, and they do not promote to new ranks
- Each mercenary soldier comes with 1-2 tech upgrades researchable at the merc camp when captured by the player. For instance, Balearic Slingers and Rhodian Slingers can have a "Lead Sling Bullets" technology at the Merc Camp, a tech not normally available to civs with those mercs

=================================================

EXPANSIONISM vs. ISOLATIONISM
- An idea I had involved the Town Phase unlocking different "Policies". When you choose to advance to Town Phase the player is given the option of choosing one or the other Policy: 

- Expansionism unlocks building new Civic Centers, but delays defensive structures (Defense Towers, City Walls) until City Phase. The opposite is true for Isolationism:
- Isolationism unlocks building defensive structures (Defense Towers, City Walls) in Town Phase, while delaying Civic Centers until City Phase

- Once you reach City Phase, Civic Centers and Defensive Structures can both be built

=================================================

PHASING AFFECTS VISION RANGE
- As a throwback to Age of Empires 1 and 2, Phasing (or "aging up") increases vision range of all units. Vision range initially is very small in Village phase (making the game world seem big and scary, unxplored), but increases noticeably when phasing up to Town and then City phase (perhaps +25% each time, which also coincidentally coincides with territory expansion)

=================================================

BLACKSMITH
- Becomes available in Village Phase for "barbarian" civs: Celt, Gaul, Brit, Iber (and later Sueb, Goth, Frank, Sarm, Daci, Huns, et al.)
- Becomes available in Town Phase for "imperial" civs: Athen, Spart, Mace, Sele, Ptol, Rome, Cart, Pers, Maur (and later Imp, Dom, Parth, Sass, et al.)

"I believe that the Gauls in adopting these methods copied the Persian regiment of the Ten Thousand, who were called the Immortals. There was, however, this difference. The Persians used to wait until the battle was over before replacing casualties, while the Gauls kept reinforcing the horsemen to their full number during the height of the action. This organization is called in their native speech trimarcisia, for I would have you know that marca is the Celtic name for a horse." -- Pausanias

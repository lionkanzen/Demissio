0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of ancient warfare. But you already knew that. Let's
get to how you'll be installing our mod.

If you're interested in helping us out, we'd love to hear from you! We could
always use another helping hand with the project, and you can help us get
one step closer to introducing the Chinese faction to the game in its
entirety! There are several ways to contact us and find more information:

  Web site: http://sciondevelopment.com/

  Forums: http://forum.sciondevelopment.com/

  Wiki (see our design documentation): http://wiki.sciondevelopment.com/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the mod folder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the "binaries\data\mods" folder.

Copy the "\china" folder or zip archive here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the mod
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the game will not auto-detect that a new mod folder is present.
Though this will be a feature in the future, as of Alpha VIII it is not. For the
time being, you'll need to run the game via the command line (or on UNIX,
Terminal). Where "china" is the name of the mod folder or archive:

Windows: ./pyrogenesis.exe -mod=han_china

UNIX: ./pyrogenesis -mod=han_china

Alternatively, you may rename your 'china' folder to 'internal' in the interim and
the game will load the data automatically. If you have any issues, please contact
us at support@sciondevelopment.com.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporting problems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there shouldn't be any bugs in this first release, as it's quite simply
a bunch of art assets and actors, if you experience any issues, please tell us about
it on the forums (link above)!

As always, if you experience problems with the game itself, Wildfire Games would 
really appreciate it if you'd tell them about it on Trac: trac.wildfiregames.com/
After searching to make sure it's not a duplicate, just register a new ticket and
the team will get to fixing it!
